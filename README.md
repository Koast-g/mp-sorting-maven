Description of custom sorting algorithm
---------------------------------------
This projects is design to learn how to implement veriety of different sorting algorythms like merge, insetion, selection, and quick sort.

Notes on using Copilot (or other AI)
------------------------------------
I used in class readings about sorting, Java Docs and also for my random sorting algorythms I used ChatGPT that come up with the idea of "bouncing the elemnts back and forth". we first bounce them forward and than bounce them backwards until its sorted.
